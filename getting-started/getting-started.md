# Getting Started

- Build the game in small increments
- Get a character rendering, add some movement, animations, etc.
- Build into bigger abstractions/libraries instead of starting with them
- Go one step at a time, and progress slowly with milestones along the way

This code is from [src/main.rs:5] and [src/main.rs:2] and [src/main.rs].
This link should be broken [Cargo.toml]. This link should be to download the
